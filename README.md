# VBA-challenge

In this repository, applying the VBA script to the stock data set will run through all the stock values over the course of the year specified on the tab. New output columns will include a ticker symbol of each stock, the yearly change for that stock, the annual percent change, and the total stock volume for each stock along with noting which stocks had the greatest percent increase, greatest percent decrease, and greatest total volume.

## Instructions

* Import the file named 'mod 2 code.bas' into excel.

* Run the macro on the stock data workbook, all worksheets should run at once with this code.

* The results should match the year titled screenshots uploaded into this repository with highlighted green values for positive change and red for negative. Any stocks with no change remain unhighlighted. 

## Note

* The VBA script is also provided in the word doc in case the .bas document does not open
